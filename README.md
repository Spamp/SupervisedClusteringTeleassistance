Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.6 or higher
    Git

Steps

    Clone the Repository

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/clustering-project.git
cd clustering-project

Install Required Libraries

All necessary libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them using:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
1. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (main_organizzato.py)

Prepare the dataset by preprocessing and feature engineering.

bash

python main_organizzato.py

Output: dataset_pulito.parquet
2. Determine Optimal Number of Clusters (Elbow Method) (elbow.py)

Use the Elbow Method to find the best number of clusters for your experiments.

bash

python elbow.py

Note: Define your feature combinations in the script as needed.
3. Clustering and Analysis (clustering.py)

Perform clustering using K-Prototypes and analyze the results.

bash

python clustering.py

Output:

    Numerical results in the terminal
    Visual plots (scatter plots, boxplots, bar charts)

Adjusting Parameters
Selecting Features

To run experiments with different features:

    Open clustering.py.

    Locate Feature Selection:
        Numerical Features: Around line 470
        Categorical Features: Around line 471

    Insert Your Desired Features:

    python

    # Example:
    numerical_columns_exp1 = ['et√†']
    categorical_columns_exp1 = ['tipologia_professionista_sanitario']

Available Features: Refer to main_organizzato.py starting from line 139.
Hyperparameters

Modify the clustering parameters directly in clustering.py:

    Number of Clusters (k): Line 467

    python

k_clusters = 4

Number of Runs (n_init): Line 537

python

n_init = 4

Max Iterations (max_iter): Line 538

python

    max_iter = 50

Visualization

After running clustering.py, several plots will appear sequentially:

    Scatter Plot: Geographical distribution of clusters.
    Boxplots: Distribution of numerical variables per cluster.
    Bar Charts: Distribution of categorical variables per cluster.
    Incremento Teleassistenza Distribution: Target variable distribution within clusters.

Note: Save plots using the save button in the plot window. Close each plot to view the next one.
Additional Information
Coordinates Generation

To generate coordinates.json from dataset.parquet:

    Navigate to the coordinates Folder:

    bash

cd coordinates

Run the Script:

bash

    python generate_coordinates.py

Files:

    coordinates.json: Contains the coordinates of cities found in the dataset.
    dataset.parquet: Original dataset file used for generating coordinates.

Elbow Method Experiments

In elbow.py, define different feature combinations using a dictionary to generate elbow plots and identify the optimal k for each experiment.
Clustering Interactions

The clustering.py script allows you to:

    Numerical Variables: Modify which numerical features to include.
    Categorical Variables: Choose which categorical features to consider.
    Hyperparameters: Adjust k, n_init, and max_iter to fine-tune the clustering models.
